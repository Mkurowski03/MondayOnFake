# Problem description: Correlation of timeframes and swing analysis across multiple timeframes

The objective of this project is to explore possible mathematical correlations between various timeframes (from W1 to M5) to identify potential trend reversals or interdependencies. Specifically, the project will investigate whether the behavior of higher timeframes (e.g., D1) can be predicted or confirmed by lower timeframes (e.g., H4, H1).

## Scope

1. **Weekly and Daily Timeframe Analysis:**
   - Investigate the behavior of W1-D1 timeframes in terms of opening and closing prices.
   - Analyze potential correlations between Mondayâ€™s D1 and other days of the week.

2. **Lower Timeframe Analysis:**
   - Explore whether smaller timeframes (e.g., H4 marking D1, H1 marking H4, and M5 marking M15 and H1) exhibit any correlation or trend reversal signals.

3. **Market Conditions and ATR:**
   - Examine how swings are affected by market conditions, such as oversold or overbought states, using ATR and standard market volatility.

4. **Entry Points and Risk Management:**
   - Investigate optimal entry points based on timeframe correlations.
   - Study how to manage risk (scaling positions, leverage) and implement effective stop-loss strategies.

5. **Confirmation Across Timeframes:**
   - Determine if confirmations on lower timeframes (e.g., M5) lead to larger moves on higher timeframes (H1, H4, D1, W1).
